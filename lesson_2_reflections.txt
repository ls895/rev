What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
  1. An empty git repository is initialized
  2. A .git hidden folder is created that is responsible for recording the revision histories of the repository
  I need to initialize the git repository for the particular directory if I want to enable revision histories and control for that directory. Only after initializing the repository can I start committing my files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
  Working directory = the entire directory that includes all the files associated with the project, in which all or only a part of the files being tracked for revision histories and control.
  Repository = A set or a controlled area where all the files inside the repository are being tracked for revision histories and control.
  Staging area = A intermediate layer between working directory and repository. Add files to the staging area, then commit the staging area to add these files to the repository and track them.
  Staging area allows user to flexibly control exactly what files to be tracked and revision controlled in the working directory.
